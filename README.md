Photonic Bandgap and Logic Gates with Meep

This repository demonstrates how to use Meep, an open-source electromagnetic simulation tool, to model photonic bandgap (PBG) structures, waveguides, beam splitters, and photonic logic gates based on interferometry. The simulations focus on 2D photonic crystals and Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based logic gates.
Prerequisites

Meep: Install via conda (conda install -c conda-forge meep) or build from source.
Python Libraries: Install numpy, matplotlib, and h5py:pip install numpy matplotlib h5py


MPB (Mode Solver): For band structure calculations, install MPB (included with Meep via conda).
Python: Version 3.6+ recommended.

Project Structure

waveguide.py: Simulates a 2D photonic crystal waveguide by introducing a defect in a square lattice.
beam_splitter.py: Models a Y-junction beam splitter in a photonic crystal.
logic_gate.py: Implements a photonic AND gate using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
band_structure.py: Computes the band structure of the photonic crystal to identify the bandgap.

Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MitchP516/Photonic-Bandgap-Modeling
cd photonic-bandgap-meep


Run a simulation, e.g.:
python waveguide.py


Outputs:

Each script generates a plot of the electric field (Ez) and/or flux data.
Use Matplotlib for visualization or save data with h5py for further analysis.



Notes

Simulation Parameters: Adjust resolution, cell_size, or until in scripts for accuracy vs. speed.
Frequency: Ensure the source frequency lies within the photonic bandgap (see band_structure.py output).
Extensions: Modify geometries or phase shifts to model other logic gates (OR, NOT).
